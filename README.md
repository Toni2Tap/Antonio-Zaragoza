Hello, I'm Antonio, a former electrician transitioning into data analytics. I recently graduated from the TripleTen BIA course, where I gained proficiency in Python, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI. I'm excited to apply these new skills and leverage my problem-solving abilities in this dynamic field.

I took a break from employment to fully focus on my studies and complete the TripleTen BIA course, where I gained valuable skills in Python, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI. This allowed me to dedicate my time and energy to mastering data analytics and preparing for my career transition.

Some facts about me:
- I enjoy building and upgrading computers for myself and my friends
- On my free time I really enjoy gaming
- My goal for 2025 is to have a successful career change
- I have a dog named Ca$h
